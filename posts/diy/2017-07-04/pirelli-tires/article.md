Lorenzo and Sarah, two nice friends, told me they decided to go to live together in a new house, partially furnished, they also told me the intention to gradually furnish the rooms.

Some days ago, invited me to see the apartment that impressed me for the nice ambients inside. It’s full of different areas which can be used in various ways.

They are interested in DIY style, so I decided to give them a push by crafting a coffee table for the sitting room, one of the first rooms they’d like to furnish.

By some week, I’ve put a pair of tires in my warehouse I thought to use in some way, maybe to craft a small coffee table to place near my sofa, at the and I decided to use these tires for them.
